# Pre-Commit Check

## End-of-Edit Gate

After modifying code, run the repo's pre-commit gate before final handoff unless the user explicitly asks not to run checks. Prefer checking only changed files first because it matches what a real commit will run and avoids unrelated legacy failures:

```bash
wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-24.04 -- bash -lc '
  source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate tf &&
  cd /home/brais/code/DL-Forecasting &&
  pre-commit run
'
```

Use `pre-commit run --all-files` only when the change is broad, touches shared configuration, or the user asks for a full check.

## Performance budgets

- Unit tests (pre-commit): `pytest -m unit` must finish in under 500 ms total. Tests that cannot meet this budget belong in `integration/`.
- Integration tests (pre-push): `pytest -m integration` must finish in under 5 s total. Tests that cannot meet this budget belong in `e2e/` or `perf/`.

## Failure Handling

If hooks auto-modify files, inspect the diff, keep intended fixes, and rerun `pre-commit run` until it passes or only unrelated pre-existing failures remain.

If a hook fails:

- Fix failures caused by the current edits.
- Do not clean up unrelated legacy violations unless they block proving the current change and the smallest practical fix is clear.
- For pytest failures, use the `pytest` skill before debugging or rerunning tests.
- For Python files under `app/`, remember the `optimization-review` skill still applies after functional edits; do that review before the final pre-commit gate when both skills trigger.

### The incremental mypy/ruff/xenon/loc ratchet

`scripts/git-hooks/incremental-precommit/ratchet_check.py` (README.md in that folder) blocks only
when a vector's **project-wide** count regresses past `baseline*.json` AND **staged app Python
files** report a nonzero count for that vector — never for pre-existing debt alone. When it blocks:

- Added files (`git status` shows `A`) have no pre-existing version — every violation on them is
  attributable to the current change and must be fixed, not waved off as legacy debt.
- Modified files (`git status` shows `M`) only need violations your edit actually introduced fixed;
  if unclear, diff the error count against `git show HEAD:<path>` run through the same tool.
- A blocked/nonzero `pre-commit run` means the commit did not happen. Never report the task done or
  move on while it's blocked without telling the user explicitly — fix it, or get their sign-off to
  proceed anyway.

## Reporting

In the final response, state whether `pre-commit run` passed. If it did not pass, include the failing hook names and whether the failures appear related to the current edits.
